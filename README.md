# Stocks Uncovered: Web Scraping and Time Series Analysis

## Overview
This project introduces web scraping and time series analysis to gain insights into stock markets. Over four weeks, participants will learn how to collect, clean, and analyze stock data, working up to building a basic predictive model. No prior experience is required; each week builds on foundational concepts.

### Objectives
- **Web Scraping**: Learn techniques to collect stock data from websites.
- **Data Cleaning and Processing**: Organize and clean data for analysis.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Understand trends, seasonality, and apply basic statistical methods.
- **Prediction Models**: Build simple forecasting models to predict stock prices.

### **Week 3: Introduction to Time Series Analysis**

#### **Objective**
To understand fundamental concepts of time series analysis, including trends and seasonality.

#### **Topics**
- Basics of time series data and its visualization.
- Simple moving averages and trend analysis.

#### **Resources**
- **Primary Resource**: [STAT-510](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat510/)
  - Read lessons 1, 2, 3, and 4 (theoretical concepts).
- **Python Practicals**:
  - Learn to use ARIMA and SARIMA models from the `statsmodels.tsa` package.
  - [Microsoft Introduction to ML: ARIMA](https://github.com/microsoft/ML-For-Beginners/tree/main/7-TimeSeries/2-ARIMA): Also try to do `assignment.md` given [here](https://github.com/microsoft/ML-For-Beginners/blob/main/7-TimeSeries/2-ARIMA/assignment.md).

> **Note**: The recommended book includes R code examples, which are not essential for this course. Python is sufficient for our purposes. If interested, you may explore additional chapters for further learning.

#### **Demo**
- **Stock-related Time Series Analysis**:
  - [Kaggle Tutorial: Everything You Can Do With a Time Series](https://www.kaggle.com/code/thebrownviking20/everything-you-can-do-with-a-time-series)
    - A comprehensive tutorial, though it may be slightly outdated for local execution. Use the "copy and run" feature on Kaggle for experimentation.
- **General Time Series**:
  - [Kaggle Tutorial: Avocado Price Forecast with ARIMA/SARIMA](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tanmay111999/avocado-price-forecast-arima-sarima-detailed#Time-Series-Analysis)

> **Note**: Focus on ARIMA and SARIMA as foundational tools. For those with a background in Machine Learning or an interest in advanced techniques, consider exploring [Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network), [NN for forcasting](https://medium.com/microsoftazure/neural-networks-for-forecasting-financial-and-economic-time-series-6aca370ff412).

#### **Activities**
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Scrape stock data from websites.
2. **Visualization**:
   - Plot stock data to identify patterns.
3. **Analysis**:
   - Compute moving averages to smooth trends.
