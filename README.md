# Stocks Uncovered: Web Scraping and Time Series Analysis

## Overview
This project introduces web scraping and time series analysis to gain insights into stock markets. Over four weeks, participants will learn how to collect, clean, and analyze stock data, working up to building a basic predictive model. No prior experience is required; each week builds on foundational concepts.

### Objectives
- **Web Scraping**: Learn techniques to collect stock data from websites.
- **Data Cleaning and Processing**: Organize and clean data for analysis.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Understand trends, seasonality, and apply basic statistical methods.
- **Prediction Models**: Build simple forecasting models to predict stock prices.
